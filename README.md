>Spread over an area of 36 km with an altitude ranging 600-900m above sea level, Araku Valley offers breathtaking views of the **waterfalls** and streams running through its valley depths. Thanks to its pleasant climate and beautiful hills, this valley is home to several coffee plantations and over 17 different tribal societies. You can swing by the Araku Tribal Museum to gain some insight into the lifestyles of these local tribes. If you have the opportunity, make sure to check out a performance of ‘Dhimsa’ dance, **a cultural event in the region full of expert movement and colorful costumes**.
